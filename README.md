This is the repo related to the paper "Community Detection in Brain Connectome using Quantum Annealer Devices" Wierzbinski et al. 

This is a brain community detection algorithm running on the Chimera architecture of the DWave quantum annealer.

### Requirements
To run the community detection code, a series of library are required which can be satisfied by running the line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
This might also require a Dwave token to access the quantum computing resources: https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html
